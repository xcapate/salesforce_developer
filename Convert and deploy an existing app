1) Create a Project and Scratch Org
	sfdx force:project:create -n MutualFundExplorer

2) Create a scratch org with the alias TempUnmanaged and set it as your default
	sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a TempUnmanaged -s

3) Install the Unmanaged Package
	sfdx force:package:install -p 04t46000001DnYm -w 3

4) If the package install doesn't complete in time, run the force:package:install:report command that's displayed by the force:package:install command. The report command looks something like this:
	sfdx force:package:install:report -i <id> -u TempUnmanaged

5) Open the scratch org
	sfdx force:org:open

6) Create the Permission Set
	From Setup, enter Permission Sets in the Quick Find box, then select Permission Sets.
	Click New.
	For Label, enter DreamInvest.
	For API Name, enter DreamInvest.
	Click Save.
	Under Apps, click Assigned Apps | Edit.
	Under Available Apps, select DreamInvest (DreamInvest), then click Add to move it to Enabled Apps.
	Click Save.	

7) Run the following command in the CLI:
	sfdx force:source:pull -u TempUnmanaged

8) Extract the Package Source to Your Project
	create a folder called mdapipackage

9) Retrieve the contents of the DreamInvest package into the mdapipackagefolder
	sfdx force:mdapi:retrieve -s -r ./mdapipackage -p DreamInvest -u TempUnmanaged -w 10

10) Unzip the unpackaged.zip file.
11) Delete the unpackaged.zipfile

12) Now you have all the source for the app in metadata format. Next, convert the source files to source format

13) Convert the Source and Push It to a New Scratch Org
	Why do we convert the metadata source to source format? Metadata format was never designed for developers to work with. It’s stored in one massive file in the production org. Source format breaks up the metadata into smaller files. This makes it easier for development teams to interact with the source and use a VCS.

14) From the MutualFundExplorer folder, convert the contents of the mdapipackage folder
	sfdx force:mdapi:convert -r mdapipackage/

15) Voila! All the converted source is now in the force-app folder. Why that folder? Because that’s the default specified in sfdx-project.json.

16) Clean up your project by deleting the mdapipackage folder.
17) Delete the scratch org
	sfdx force:org:delete -u TempUnmanaged

18) Verify Your Work
	Did all of that work? The easiest way to find that out is to spin up a new scratch org and try it out. Since you didn’t create this app, you’ll assign a permission set that gives you access to the app.

19) Create a new scratch org
	sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json

20) Push your local source and metadata to the scratch org
	sfdx force:source:push

21) Assign a permission set
	sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n DreamInvest 

22) Open your org
	sfdx force:org:open

23) Deploy the Converted App Using Metadata API
	Register Your Testing Environment

24) Log in to your Trailhead Playground org and create an alias for it
	sfdx auth:web:login -a MyTP

25) Confirm that this org is available
	sfdx force:org:list

26) Convert Source to Metadata Format and Deploy
	Create a folder to put the converted files called mdapioutput

27) Next, run the convert command
	sfdx force:source:convert -d mdapioutput/

28) Deploy it to your testing environment
	sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -d mdapioutput/ -u MyTP -w 100

29) Assign a permission set:
	sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n DreamInvest -u MyTP

30) Run your tests and interact with the app:
	sfdx force:org:open -u MyTP
